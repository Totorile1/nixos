"Programming is not a science. Programming is a craft. -Richard Stallman"
"I did write some code in Java once, but that was the island in Indonesia. -Richard Stallman"

"Idiots can be defeated but they never admit it. -Richard Stallman"
"Open source is a development methodology; free software is a social movement. -Richard Stallman"

"Talk is cheap. Show me the code. -Linus Torval"
"Most of the good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program. -Linus Torvald"
"Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships. -Linus Torvald"
"If Microsoft ever does applications for Linux it means I've won. -Linus Torvald"
"Avoiding complexity reduces bugs. -Linus Torvald"

"Nobody actually creates perfect code the first time around, except me. But there's only one of me. -Linus Torvald"
"Microsoft isn't evil, they just make really crappy operating systems. -Linus Torvald"
"When you say 'I wrote a program that crashed Windows,' people just stare at you blankly and say 'Hey, I got those with the system, for free.' -Linus Torval"
"C++ is a horrible language. It's made more horrible by the fact that a lot of substandard programmers use it, to the point where it's much much easier to generate total and utter crap with it. -Linus Torvald"
"If you think your users are idiots, only idiots will use it. -Linus Torvald"
"My name is Linus, and I am your God. -Linus Torvald"
"An infinite number of monkeys typing into GNU emacs would never make a good program. -Linus Torvald"
"Object-oriented programming is an exceptionally bad idea which could only have originated in California. -Edgser Dijkstra"
"If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. -Edgser Dijkstra"
"The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity. -Edgser Dijkstra"
"Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence! -Edgser Dijkstra"
"It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration. -Edgser Dijkstra"
"The effort of using machines to mimic the human mind has always struck me as rather silly. I would rather use them to mimic something better. -Edgser Dijkstra"
"Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes. -Edgser Dijkstra"
"Programming in Basic causes brain damage. -Edgser Dijkstra"
"The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague. -Edgser Dijkstra"
"If in physics there's something you don't understand, you can always hide behind the uncharted depths of nature. You can always blame God. You didn't make it so complex yourself. But if your program doesn't work, there is no one to hide behind. You cannot hide behind an obstinate nature. If it doesn't work, you've messed up. -Edgser Dijkstra"
"Teaching COBOL ought to be regarded as a criminal act. -Edgser Dijkstra"
"If you want more effective programmers, you will discover that they should not waste their time debugging, they should not introduce the bugs to start with. -Edgser Dijkstra"
"If we wish to count lines of code, we should not regard them as 'lines produced' but as 'lines spent.' -Edgser Dijkstra"
"In almost every computation a great variety of arrangements for the succession of the processes is possible, and various considerations must influence the selections amongst them for the purposes of a calculating engine. One essential object is to choose that arrangement which shall tend to reduce to a minimum the time necessary for completing the calculation. -Ada Lovelace"
